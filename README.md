# PH Assignment
this project is a recruitment task  
company name was redacted for a reason :)

## Goal
the project is pretty simple. 

The backend is supposed to persist customers and provide an API for accessing their information.   
Customers can then be displayed on the frontend.

The user should be able to:  
- Filter and sort the list of customers.  
- Click on a customer in the list to view their details and add/edit notes for that customer.  
- Change their status.  


Customers have the following information associated with them:  
- Unique customer identifier.  
- Status: one of "prospective", "current" or "non-active".  
- Creation date and time.  
- General information like name and contact details.  

## Project Structure
you can find two modules in this project: `frontend` and `backend`. Names are pretty self-explanatory...

each module has its own `README.MD` file that describes:
- technologies used (briefly)  
- how to build it  
- how to run it  

## General comments
I'll try to make a comment here whenever I make a shortcut as a result of a tight deadline.
