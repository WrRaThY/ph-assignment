# PH Assignment - frontend

## Technologies used
I've chosen Angular5, because it's the latest, stable version of this framework.  
I have some production experience with AngularJS and gone over tutorials in Angular 2, 4 and 5, so this sounds like a safe choice  

I thought about React, but chose not to go with it because:  
- I have just a couple of days of experience with it
- I really enjoy writing in TypeScript
- `Angular CLI` is a better tool than `create-react-app`
- TS/Angular IntelliJ IDEA support seems to be better

I thought about using good, old JSPs or Faces, but lets be honest - where is the fun in that? :)  
Since I'm spending my private on it I can learn something new along the way - hence Angular5.  

I also used [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), which makes setting up a project like this one a pleasure.  
THANK YOU. Without projects like Angular CLI setting this up would take days!  
This short documentation also uses what was generated with Angular CLI.


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server.  
Navigate to `http://localhost:9090/` to start using the app.  
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.  
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

The application can then be served using any HTTP server, for example Apache.
